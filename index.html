        LEGAL LEGEND: An amended offering statement relating to Props Tokens has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission but has not yet become qualified. No money or other consideration is being solicited, and if sent in response, will not be accepted. No offer to buy the securities can be accepted and no part of the purchase price or other consideration can be received, until the amended offering statement is qualified, and any such offer may be withdrawn or revoked, without obligation or commitment of any kind, at any time before notice of its acceptance given after the qualification date. No offer to sell any securities, and no solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, is being made in any jurisdiction in which such offer, sale or solicitation would not be permitted by applicable law. Prior to qualification of the amended offering statement, Open Props Inc. may also engage in “testing the waters” with respect to the sale of Props Tokens under Regulation A of the Securities Act. The “testing the waters” process allows companies to determine whether there may be interest in an eventual offering of their securities to qualified purchasers under Regulation A. If and when Open Props Inc. conducts an offering under Regulation A of the Securities Act, it will do so only once (i) the SEC has qualified the amended offering statement, and (ii) investors have subscribed to the offering in the manner provided for in the amended offering statement.
